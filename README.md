# Network monitor for XFCE4 generic monitor plugin

It automatically assign the interface. Also, I don't know if its problem with xfce panel or my code or even my pc, but I can't seem to add tooltips to this code.

You may also need to change the permissions for `~/.cache/rx_prev_bytes` and `~/.cache/tx_prev_bytes` into 446 or writtable by public. Or you can run this command: `chmod 446 ~/.cache/rx_prev_bytes && chmod 446 ~/.cache/tx_prev_bytes`
